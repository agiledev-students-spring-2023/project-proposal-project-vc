# Title: Virtual Classroom

## What and Why?
The idea is to create a new virtual classroom simulator application accessible directly through a web browser. The classroom includes a whiteboard, a student area, a chatbox and a screenshare feature. With this application, participants are not required to share their camera to take part in the classroom; rather, the app uses AI to detect the presence of the participants and display their avatar on the screen. Furthermore, the app is also able to detect hand gestures, such as raising an arm, and display the relevant avatar. This app is distinct from other virtual classrooms such as Zoom as it is more interactive and does not require participants to activate their cameras, which may be uncomfortable for some.

## For Whom?
The app is intended to be used by teachers to host online classrooms. Students can join the classroom if they have access to it.

## How? 
It will allow user to create "host" account and invite participants to join the classroom
As a student, one can join the classroom; they can choose their avatar type and microphone settings. 
The host can share their screen or use the whiteboard. The host can also use the audio feature to speak to the participants.
Both, host and students, can use the chat feature.

## Scope
The project consists of multiple components. A comprehensive app with all necessary features would require more than a single semester; however, it is feasible to develop a MVP with key features (user authentication, virtual classroom with whiteboard and chatbox, hand gesture recognition and participant presence detection) in one semester.
